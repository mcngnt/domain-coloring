# domain-coloring
 
## Domain coloring tool for visualizing the output of different functions

## How does it works ?
This programm allow visualizing the zeros of a complex function. In the input panel, the user can move the mouse and change the input value. This input value represent the result of f(output value). In the output panel, the user can see where the output value is on the complex plane. Darker an area is, closer it is to a zero of the function. The color depends of the angle of the value relative to the real axis.

## Controls
- Move mouse to change the input/output value
- Zoom out with the scroll whell  
- Change the visualized function with the left and right arrows
